### Reasons to use **Shell Script Library**

- Benefits
    1. [x] **Shell Script Library** turns your scripts safer and more portable.
        > The source code is more than 90% compatible with `POSIX`.

    1. [x] The function were built using static types from Cotowali.
        > The static types are going be preserved **only** in case you keep develop using Cotowali programming language.

    1. [x] Easy installation setup.
        > All functions are up be imported from declaring only one single line. Local or online file.
    
    1. [x] You can static the **Shell Script Library** version your project should use.
        > In case of deprecated functions on the newest updates, all the older versions are still available to be consulted or downloaded by set the specific version up.

        > In case of setup up the latest version, the functions are going to be updated automatic by generate your own source code.
    
    1. [x] **Shell Script Library** source code follows the clear code philosophy.
        > Functions names have detailed description defined on their own names. It reduces the number of lines by removing the unneeded commentaries whose would describe what each command does.
        
        > Each function does one action and each one of them returns only what it is expected (nothing more, nothing less).

### Warnings

1. **Shell Script Library** is provide without warranty of any kind, express or implied, about damages or errors. The author of this project is able to claim about the credits about any change on the structure of this project, including forks according to the GPL3 license. In another hand by using the **Shell Script Library** generated contents on your project you do not have to set GPL3 license. For example:
    > By forking the **Shell Script Library** project and making some changes on the library, you have follow the GPL3 license to the new library version and also attribute the credits to the original creator.
    
    > By using the **Shell Script Library** to develop your project without changing a single line from the library source code, your project is free from the GPL3 license except the **Shell Script Library** generated code. This part must be intact on your source code.

    > **Shell Script Library** has been developed to help you to develop your source code for personal and commercial usage. So, do not take advantages without attributing the credits to the original creator.
    
    > Besides forking for maintaining your own version, fork this project to improve this project with commits to the main streaming repository and let us make the **Shell Script Library** to become the default one.

1. It is very import to mention some functions may provide longer commands than calling from normal Shell Script files. By the way what **Shell Script Library** looks for is a way to make these commands safer to be developed without worrying about lots of verifications.

1. **Shell Script Library** has the intention to provide an entire ecosystem whose understand the action is set to be done with a few commands but looking for the best possible scenario to solve the problem.

1. Have in mind some Shell Script commands may change according to the operating system. The **Shell Script Library** understand this problem exists and works hard for providing a unique interface. In others words, the developer does not need to think in every possible scenario whose his script file will be run. Bit by bit this library is implementing solutions to solve this kind of problem.

1. Once your source code is developed using the **Shell Script Library** you do not to worry about updates breaks up. You can set a specific version from this library or even use the latest one available. Using the latest one may be not recommended for production but the biggest advantage is coding using `Cotowali` programming language and be able to receive new feature and fix issues without changing a single line from the source code.

1. Besides the **Shell Script Library** pursuits the `POSIX` all the implemented functions have been tested **only** on `Linux` platform. In the future we have plans to test the functions on `BSD` and `MacOS` before we test on `Windows` platform.

## Examples

### Example 1 - Cotowali

#### Source code

### Example 2 - Shell Script

- Source code 

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

. /dev/stdin <<< "$(curl -L -s https://github.com/henrikbeck95/shell_script_library/releases/download/v1.1.0/shsl.sh)"

clear

str_edit_replace_character_argument_from_lower_to_upper "Shell Script Library"
math_operator_calculator "27^(1/3)"
```

- Result

```text
